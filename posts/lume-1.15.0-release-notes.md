The version **1.15.0** is full of exciting new features.

<!-- more -->

## Archetypes

[Hugo has a nice feature called **archetypes**](https://gohugo.io/content-management/archetypes/),
templates used when creating new content. The most obvious example is a post:
instead of creating a new markdown file from scratch everytime you want to
create a new post, you can run an archetype that creates the post file for you
with a preconfigured front matter and content.

In Lume, an archetype is just a JavaScript or TypeScript file that export a
function returning an object with the file path and the file content. The
archetype must be saved in the `_archetypes` directory, inside the `src` folder.
For example:

```ts
// _archetypes/example.js

export default function () {
  return {
    path: "/pages/example.md",
    content: "Content of the file",
  };
}
```

The archetypes are invoked with the command
`deno task lume new [archetype-name]` (or `lume new [archetype-name]` if you're
using the new [Lume CLI](./lume-cli.md)) so have to run `lume new example` to
run this archetype and create the file `/pages/example.md`.

See the [archetypes documentation](https://lume.land/docs/core/archetypes/) to
learn how to create different formats, pass arguments or create multiple files.

## Tailwindcss

[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) support is a recurring request for Lume.
Until now it was not possible to use Tailwind in Deno, so the only alternative
available was [Windi CSS](https://lume.land/plugins/windi_css/).

The support of `npm:` packages in Deno allowed to use many NPM packages that
until now only work on Node. Still, there were errors in Tailwind due the
[`acorn-node`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/acorn-node) dependency that doesn't
work on Deno due the usage of `__proto__`.

The [`@lumeland`](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40lumeland) organization in
NPM contains modified versions of the packages that don't work in Deno.
[`@lumeland/tailwindcss`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lumeland/tailwindcss)
is the same code as [`tailwindcss`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwindcss)
but replacing that dependency. When this is fixed in the official library, this
modified version will be deprecated.

The Tailwindcss plugin depends on `postcss`, so you need to use both plugins in
this exact order:

```ts
import lume from "lume/mod.ts";
import tailwind from "lume/plugins/tailwindcss.ts";
import postcss from "lume/plugins/postcss.ts";

const site = lume();

site.use(tailwind());
site.use(postcss());

export default site;
```

## Context data

The function `site.data()` allows to insert arbitrary data in your site from the
`_config.ts` file:

```ts
site.data("layout", "main.njk");
```

The context of this data is global: is available to all pages of the site. It's
equivalent to create a `_data.*` file in the root of your site. As of Lume
1.15.0, it's possible to specify the directory of the data. This means that this
data will be assigned only to that directory and subdirectories. For example:

```ts
site.data("layout", "main.njk", "/posts");
```

Now, the `layout` value is available only to the pages inside the `/posts`
directory. Equivalent to creating a `/posts/_data.yml` file with this value.

You can assign data not only to directories but also to specific files:

```ts
site.data("layout", "main.njk", "/posts/hello-world.md");
```

## Breaking changes in the plugin `date`

The `date` plugin used the
[Deno version of `date_fns`](https://deno.land/x/date_fns@v2.15.0) to transform
the dates. The Deno's version wasn't updated in 2 years so I decided to switch
to [the Node version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/date-fns). Everything should
work fine, the only difference is the locales configuration, that need to be
imported from npm in the _config file. For example, if you have this
configuration:

```ts
site.use(date({
  locales: ["gl", "pt"],
}));
```

You need to change it to:

```ts
import gl from "npm:date-fns/locale/gl/index.js";
import pt from "npm:date-fns/locale/pt/index.js";

//...
site.use(date({
  locales: { gl, pt },
}));
```

## Other changes

- The `sass` plugin uses a
  [modified version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lumeland/sass) of the
  official NPM package.
- The `relations` plugin has been improved and there are some breaking changes
  in the configuration API.
  [See the documentation](https://lume.land/plugins/relations/) for the updated
  info.
- Dependency update and bugfixes.

See the
[CHANGELOG.md file](https://github.com/lumeland/lume/blob/v1.15.0/CHANGELOG.md)
for the full list of changes.
